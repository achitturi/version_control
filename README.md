# version_control
Why is version control important?

The goal of "version control" in Github is to keep a record of changes to a file (or set of files), giving any user the ability to recall a specific version of the file from a given time in the past. Using version control, a developer can revert individual files or entire projects back to a previous stable state. This is useful for comparing versions to identify specific modifications made by specific users. It can be used to find when an erroneous line of code was introduced into the file, or when a certain problem first popped up in the project. This also allows easy file recovery in case of a more severe error that leads to the loss of the current version. When centralized among several users, version control provides another benefit in that it allows collaboration by multiple developers on a single project. Each developer can push and pull various changes to a single server, which contains every version of the file.
